- In java every varibale and expression has some type, each and every data type is clearly defined, every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatibility(`java language is strongly typed`)



## Indentifiers:
- You can use alphabet characters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), the underscore symbol (_), and the dollar sign ($).
- We can use any class and interface name as indentifiers, but we can't use reseved keywords
- In Java we have 53 reserved word.
    - reserved word(53)
        - keywords(50)
            - used keywords(48)
                - datatypes`(byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char)`
            - unused keywords(2)
                - goto
                - const
        - Reserved literals(3)
            - true
            - false
            - null

Note: in java return type is mandatory, if a method don't return anything we have to declare the method with `void` return tyep.


### keywords:
- We can use `enum` to define a group of names constants.
- e.g.
```java
enum months {
    jan, feb, march, april, ...
}
```

### Premitive datatypes:
- `byte`
    - size 1 byte(8 bits)
    - range of values: +127 to - 128

- `short`
    - size 2 bytes(16 bits)

- `int`
    - size 4 bytes(32 bits)

- `long`
    - size 8 bytes(64 bits)

Note: the character in a big file is might exceed the int range that's why the return type of `length()` method is `long`

- `float`
    - if we require less floating point accuracy
    - 4 bytes(32 bits)

- `double`
    - if we require more floating point accuracy than float
    - 8 bytes(64 bits)

- `boolean`
    - size NA[vm dependable]
    - range: NA(allowed values are true/false)

- `char`
    - char is unicode based
    - size 2 bytes(16 bits)
