# Java Source File Structure

- A java program can contain any number of classes, but atmost one class can be declare as public. If there is a public class then name of the program and name of the public class should be same.

- Whenever compiling a java program for every class present in the program a separate .class file will be generated.

- We can compile a java program(java source file), but we can run a java .class file

- Whenever we executing a java class, the corresponding class main method will be executed. if the class does't contain main method then we will get runtime erro: NoSuchMethodError:Main

**Fully Qualified name for class:**
```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.ArrayList a = new java.util.ArrayList();
    }
}
```

**There are two types of imports:**

**Explicite class import**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

**Implicit class import**
```java
import java.util.*;
```

**Priority of import statements:**
1. Explicit class import
2. Class present in CWD
3. Implicit class import

Note: Whenever we are importing a java pkg, all classes and interfaces present in the pkg by default available but not sub pkg class and interfaces.

Note: Java language import statement is load on demand/fly not in the starting

- java
    - util
        - regex
            - pattern

```java
//will only access class & interfaces inside java pkg only
import java.* /
```
