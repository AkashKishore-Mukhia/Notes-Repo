# Software Defined Access

## Logical Networking Plane's

1. Control Plane
    - Control plane is responsible for exchanging routing information.
    - Determines how packet should be forwarded.
    - Determines which path to use to forward packets.
    - Protocols: OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, RIP, ISIS, LISP, ARP, STP, VTP.
    - Control palne build the data base used by data plane for forwarding
    - RIB and LIB belongs to the control plane.
    - **Control Plane Tasks:**
        - Leans MAC addresses
        - Builds MAC address table
        - Build ARP table
        - STP to create a loop-free topology
        - Build routing table
    
    > Think of `contorl plane` as brain of a network.

2. Data Plane
    - Also know as forwarding palne.
    - Responsible for forwarding traffic/packets.
    - Data plane packets go through router(unline control plane for adjcent devices)
    - Contorl plance should be functional for data plane to work
    - FIB and LFIB belong to data plane.
    - ACL, QOS, FIB, VXLAN.
    - **Data Plane Tasks:**
        - Match IP destiantion in the routing table
        - Match MAC addresses for forwardings
        - Encapsulate/Decapsulate packates
        - Adding/Removing headers.

    > Think of `data palne` as who does the physical task. one who moves the packet from one place to other.

3. Management Plane
    - We interact with devices through management plane.
    - Uses for Access, Contorl and Monitor of devices.
    - Access device through cli, gui.
    - Protocols: telent, SSH, SNMP, etc...
    - We can push config/script/templets from management plane
    - Automation is implemented from management plane.

    > Think of `management plane` as an access door to devices.


## SDN (Software Defined Networking)
![SDN](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11277-020-07407-x/MediaObjects/11277_2020_7407_Fig1_HTML.png)

- A network driven by software/policy/application/template
- SDN is a architectural design to make a network more flexible and easier to manage.
- Larger networks are hard to manage so cetralized management required.
- In traditional networking we use distributed control plane in which every device manage it's own control plane(SDN controller, manage the control palne of those devices)
- SDN use the concept of cetralized control plane which is provided by central controller.
- SDN decouples control plane from data plane.
- SDN use API
