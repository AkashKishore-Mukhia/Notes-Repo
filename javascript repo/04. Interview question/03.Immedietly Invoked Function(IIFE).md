## What is Immediately Invoked Function
Immediately Invoked function is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.


```javascript
//syntax
(function() {
    // do something
})();
```
Note: The first set of parenthesis here is for geting rid of the error thrown by javascript because of wrong declaration of function(without function name). And the second set of parenthesis is to invoke the function.
