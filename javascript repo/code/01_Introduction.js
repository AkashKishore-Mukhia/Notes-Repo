// Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a technique used by JavaScript engines (like V8) to improve performance. 
// Here’s how it works
    // Interpretation: Initially, the code is interpreted line-by-line by the engine.
    // Hot Code Detection: The engine identifies frequently executed code, such as often-called functions.
    // Compilation: The “hot” code is compiled into optimized machine code for faster execution.
    // Execution: The compiled machine code is then executed directly, improving performance compared to repeated interpretation.
    // JIT compilation balances between interpretation (for quick startup) and compilation (for faster execution).
