# Memory management

**The Memory allocations for different datatype are below**

|Data types| Memory Location | 
|---------|-----------------|
|priemtive datatypes| Call Stack|
|Object referance | Call Stack |
|Objects | Heap |


## Shallow copy Vs Deep copy

> Cocept Example:
```js
const Emma = {
  firstName: 'Emma',
  lastName: 'Watson',
  family: ['ivan', 'tyson', 'rayn']
}

// both Emma and Emmacopy are pointing to the same Object
const EmmaCopy = Emma;
// since the EmmaCopy also referancing to the same object & mutating lastName it's also effecting the original object property 
EmmaCopy.lastName = 'Elona';

console.log('Before:', Emma);
console.log('After:', EmmaCopy);
```

> Cocept Example:

To overcome the above problem we could you the below solution, but their is a caviate in this solution as well, that well takle in the next example.

```js

const Emma = {
  firstName: 'Emma',
  lastName: 'Watson',
  family: ['ivan', 'tyson', 'rayn']
}

// we are using ...spread operator which will enumerate Emma Object
const EmmaCopy = {...Emma};

EmmaCopy.lastName = 'Elona';
```

since we are using the `spread(...)` operator here, the propeties and value enumerating macking a new object altogher, that why changing the lastName is not effecting the `Emma` object.


`Note:` their is a problem with this example as well we'll see that in next example.

> Concept Example:
```js
const Emma = {
  firstName: 'Emma',
  lastName: 'Watson',
  family: ['ivan', 'tyson', 'rayn']
}

// we are using ...spread operator which will enumerate Emma Object
const EmmaCopy = {...Emma};

// adding two more family memebers to the EmmaCopy object
EmmaCopy.family.push('Sally');
EmmaCopy.family.push('sharen');
```

if you console log both object, you'll see that along with EmmaCopy Object Emma object is also getting effect.

Why is this happening :question:
because, all object are allocated in the heap memory, and here the array is a object, so the `family` referance variable referancing  to the same array, for the both object, that why altering one array object is effecting another(it's also know as shallow copy).


> Concept Example:
To overcome the above problem we can use the below shown example way(this way is know as Deep copy)
```js
const Emma = {
  firstName: 'Emma',
  lastName: 'Watson',
  family: ['ivan', 'tyson', 'rayn']
}

// structuredClone()
const EmmaCopy = structuredClone(Emma);

// adding two more family memebers to the EmmaCopy object
EmmaCopy.family.push('Sally');
EmmaCopy.family.push('sharen');

console.log('Before:', Emma);
console.log('After:', EmmaCopy);
```


## Passing by vs Passing by value:

All the priemtive type of data type are passed by value, their is not passing by referance concept, thought you will find when you pass with referance variale you might find an expection, just because we are passing referance to that object.
