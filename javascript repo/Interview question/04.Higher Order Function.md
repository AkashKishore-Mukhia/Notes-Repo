## Higher Order Function
Functions that operate on other functions, by taking then as an argument or returning them, are called higher order functions;


```javascript
//exmaple of higher order functions
```


```javascript
// function taking another function as arguments
function higherOrderFunction(fn) {
    fn();
}
function fn() {
    console.log('output: functions \'fn\' is executed from higher order funtions')
}

higherOrderFunction(fn);
```

    output: functions 'fn' is executed from higher order funtions
    


```javascript
// function that is returning another function
function HigherOrder() {
    var val = 3;
    return () => {
        console.log('output: HigherOrder function internal value: ', val);
    }
}

var x = HigherOrder();
x();
```

    output: HigherOrder function internal value:  3
