<!-- Is JavaScript compiled or interpreted or both?

JavaScript is both compiled and interpreted. In the earlier versions of JavaScript, it used only the interpreter that executed code line by line and shows the result immediately. But with time the performance became an issue as interpretation is quite slow. Therefore, in the newer versions of JS, probably after the V8, JIT compiler was also incorporated to optimize the execution and display the result more quickly. -->


<!-- Why JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language?

JavaScript is considered as lightweight due to the fact that it has low CPU usage, is easy to implement and has a minimalist syntax. Minimalist syntax as in, it has no data types. Everything is treated here as an object. It is very easy to learn because of its syntax similar to C++ and Java. -->
