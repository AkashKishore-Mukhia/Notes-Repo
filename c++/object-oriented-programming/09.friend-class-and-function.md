# Friend Class and Fucntion
--- 

**Friend Class:** A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class.

**syntax**
```cpp
friend class calss-name;  
```

**Friend Function:** Is like friend class, a friend function can be given a special grant to access private and protected members. A friend function can be: 
- **A member of another class**
- **A global function**

- A friend function is a special function in C++ which in-spite of not being member function of a class has privilege to access private and protected data of a class.
- A friend function is a non member function or ordinary function of a class, which is declared as a friend using the keyword “friend” inside the class. By declaring a function as a friend, all the access permissions are given to the function.
- The keyword “friend” is placed only in the function declaration of the friend function and not in the function definition.
- When friend function is called neither name of object nor dot operator is used. However it may accept the object as argument whose value it want to access.
- Friend function can be declared in any section of the class i.e. public or private or protected.

**syntax**

```cpp
class <class_name>    
{    
    friend  <return_type>  <function_name>(argument/s);  
};
```
