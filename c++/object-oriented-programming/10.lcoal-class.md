# Local Class
---
A class declared inside a function becomes local to that function and is called Local Class in C++.

- A local class name can only be used locally i.e., inside the function and not outside it.
- The methods of a local class must be defined inside it only.
- A local class can have static functions but, not static data members.
- Member methods of the local class can only access static and enum variables of the enclosing function. Non-static variables of the enclosing function are not accessible inside local classes.
