# Classes and Objects

**Class:** A class in C++ is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented programming. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.

- A Class is a user defined data-type which has data members and member functions.
- Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and together these data members   and member functions defines the properties and behavior of the objects in a Class.

An **Object** is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Geeks   // class name
{
	public:              // Access specifier
	string geekname;     // Data Members

	void printname()    // Member fucntions()
	{
	cout << "Geekname is: " << geekname;
	}
};

int main() {

	Geeks obj1;   // Declare an object of class geeks

	obj1.geekname = "Abhi";   // accessing data member	

	obj1.printname();   // accessing member function

	return 0;
}
```
