# Inhertance
---
 
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

**Sub Class:** The class that inherits properties from another class is called Subclass or Derived Class. 
**Super Class:** The class whose properties are inherited by a subclass is called Base Class or Superclass. 

**syntax:**
```cpp
class  <derived_class_name> : <access-specifier> <base_class_name>
{
        //body
}
```

- **Modes of Inheritance**
- **Types of Inheritance**


#### # Modes of Inheritance:
---
There are 3 modes of inheritance.

1. **Public Mode:** If we derive a subclass from a public base class. Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.

2. **Protected Mode:** If we derive a subclass from a Protected base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.

3. **Private Mode:** If we derive a subclass from a Private base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become Private in the derived class.


#### # Types Of Inheritance:-
---

- **Single inheritance**
- **Multilevel inheritance**
- **Multiple inheritance**
- **Hierarchical inheritance**
- **Hybrid inheritance**

1. **Single Inheritance:** In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one subclass is inherited by one base class only.

2. **Multiple Inheritance:** Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one class. i.e one subclass is inherited from more than one base class.

3. **Multilevel Inheritance:** In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** In this type of inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.

5. **Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance:** Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance. For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
