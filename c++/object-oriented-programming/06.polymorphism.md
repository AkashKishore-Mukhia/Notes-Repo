# Polymorphism
---
The word “polymorphism” means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

In C++, polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

- **Compile-time Polymorphism**
- **Runtime Polymorphism**

#### 1.Compile-time polymorphism:
---
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

**Function Overloading:** When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters, then the functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by changing the number of arguments or/and changing the type of arguments.

**Operator Overloading:** C++ also provides the option to overload operators. For example, we can make use of the addition operator (+) for string class to concatenate two strings. We know that the task of this operator is to add two operands. So a single operator ‘+’, when placed between integer operands, adds them and when placed between string operands, concatenates them.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
	int real, imag;
public:
	Complex(int r = 0, int i =0) {real = r; imag = i;}
	
	// This is automatically called when '+' is used with
	// between two Complex objects
	Complex operator + (Complex const &obj) {   // className operator opertator-want-to-overloaded (arguments...) {}
		Complex res;
		res.real = real + obj.real;
		res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
		return res;
	}
	void print() { cout << real << " + i" << imag << endl; }
};

int main()
{
	Complex c1(10, 5), c2(2, 4);
	Complex c3 = c1 + c2; // An example call to "operator+"
	c3.print();
}
```

#### 2.Runtime polymorphism:
---
This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.

**Function overriding:** occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden. 

```cpp
// C++ program for function overriding

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
	virtual void print ()
	{ cout<< "print base class" <<endl; }

	void show ()
	{ cout<< "show base class" <<endl; }
};

class derived:public base
{
public:
	void print () //print () is already virtual function in derived class, we could also declared as virtual void print () explicitly
	{ cout<< "print derived class" <<endl; }

	void show ()
	{ cout<< "show derived class" <<endl; }
};

//main function
int main()
{
	base *bptr;
	derived d;
	bptr = &d;
	
	//virtual function, binded at runtime (Runtime polymorphism)
	bptr->print();
	
	// Non-virtual function, binded at compile time
	bptr->show();

	return 0;
}
```
