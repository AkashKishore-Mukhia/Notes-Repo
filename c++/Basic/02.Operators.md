# **Operators**

Operators are the foundation of any programming language. We can define operators as symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates the operands. For example, ‘+’ is an operator used for addition, as shown below:  
```
c = a + b;
```
Here, ‘+’ is the operator known as the `addition operator` and ‘a’ and ‘b’ are `operands`.
