## **Data Types**

**1. Fundamental data-type:**

1. Integer(int)
2. Character(char)
3. Boolean(bool)
4. Floating Point(float)
5. Double Floating Point(double)
6. Valueless or Void(void)
7. Wide Character




**2. Derived data types:**

The data types that are derived from the primitive datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types.

1. Function
2. Array
3. Pointer
4. Reference



**3. Abstact or User defined data types:**

These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, as defining a class in C++ or a structure.

1. Class
2. Structure
3. Union
4. Enumeration
5. Typedef defined Datatype



## **Datatype Modifiers**
As the name suggests, datatype modifiers are used with the built-in data types to modify the length of data that a particular data type can hold. 

1. Signed
2. Unsigned
3. Short
4. Long
