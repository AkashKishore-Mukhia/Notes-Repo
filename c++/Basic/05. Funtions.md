# **Functions**

A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.

## **const member function**

Constant member functions are those functions that are denied permission to change the values of the data members of their class. To make a member function constant, the keyword “const” is appended to the function prototype and also to the function definition header.
const memeber functions can be accessed by every type of objects.
```cpp
// Example: of Constant member function
class Demo {
	int x;

	public:
	void set_data(int a) {
		x=a;
	}

	int get_data() const {	 //constant member function
		++x;				          // Error while attempting to modify the data member
		return x;
	}

};

main() {
	Demo d;
	d.set_data(10);
	cout<<endl<<d.get_data();

	return 0;
}
```

Like member functions and member function arguments, the objects of a class can also be declared as const. an object declared as const cannot be modified and hence, can invoke only const member functions as these functions ensure not to modify the object.
const object can only invoke the const memeber functions.
```cpp
// Example: of constant object
class Test {
	int value;
public:
	Test(int v = 0) {value = v;}
	int getValue() {return value;}
};

int main() {
	const Test t;           // t object is constant type
	cout << t.getValue();   // error: since t is const type and not have permission to access non-const functions.
	return 0;
}
```
